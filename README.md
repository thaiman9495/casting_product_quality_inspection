# Description
Removing defective products required casting industry to have its quality inspection process. However, this inspection process is often carried out manually and very time-consuming. Therefore, this project is conducted to automatically classify casting defects based deep learning models such as:
- CNN model
- Transfer learning based on Xception model

# Dataset
- [Casting product image data for quality inspection from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravirajsinh45/real-life-industrial-dataset-of-casting-product)
- Put the dataset into "data" folder
